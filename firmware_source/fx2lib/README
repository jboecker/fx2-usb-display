Before building this library, you need have sdcc installed and in your path.

http://sdcc.sf.net

To build this library, run make

> make

This produces lib/fx2.lib.  You can also run make in the lib folder.

You can also build the documentation if you have doxygen installed.

> make docs

** Firmware framework Quickstart

> cd fw
> make

You can copy the fw directory to your own directory and customize it as needed.

** More custom firmware

To use routines included with this library in your own firmware,
add the include files to your include path and the lib file to your compile command:

> sdcc -mmcs51 -I<path to includes> <your c file> fx2.lib -L <path to fx2.lib dir>

fx2lib also includes an example program for loading firmware onto your device. 
See examples/fx2.


Enjoy!
