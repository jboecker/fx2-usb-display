Notes on Various things I've learned about SDCC and the FX2

* libusb on Linux
* cycfx2prog: http://www.triplespark.net/elec/periph/USB-FX2/software/index.html
 - most of this functionality is now in the fx2load package for python
 - which is in examples/fx2
* sdcc has sdcc/support/scripts/keil2sdcc.pl which I used to create the fx2regs.h file from the keil header. 
* sdcc is little endian, keil is big endian (important if doing usb communication)
* xdata can go up to 64k on the EZ-USB development board but
  - the fx2 chip itself only has 16k (end at 0x4000) Firmware written for other than the dev board
  - should use --xram-size --xram-loc etc to make sure it isn't using memory beyond 16k.
* linux has objcopy, which can be used in place of Hex2bix for bix files 
  - objcopy -I ihex -O binary --pad-to=8192 input [output]


Memory
 * 256 bytes internal
   - lower 128=registers/bits (direct or indirect)
   - upper 128=stack (or whatever but only indirect addressing)
   - sfs occupy upper 128 space only direct addressing

 * external
  - 16k on chip 0-0x3fff
  - 512 bytes on chip scratch ram 0xe000 - 0xe1ff (data memory only)
  - epbuffers and control at 0xe200-0xffff (data memory only)
  
   Only the on chip 16k and 512 bytes can be uploaded w/ eeprom or downloaded to host with SETUPPTR
   Might be possible to load the descriptors to the scratch ram instead of code ram area?

sdcc data types
  data/near=direct addressable internal memory (default for model-small)
  xdata/far=external ram (default for model-large)
  idata=indirect addressable internal memory
  pdata=access to xdata area, but uses sfr to get to address (sdcc 4.1)
  code=code memory, study this more.
  bit=uses lower 128 bit area
  

TODO:
 * Possibly add CKCON and bmSTRETCH customization
 * IN2CLR and INT4CLR registers can be used intead of explicitly clearing int2 and int4 interrupts. (Faster)
   See (15.5)
